This project is an interactive web-based assignment where random circles appear and expand upon page load. Each circle grows until it reaches a certain size, at which point it pops and disappears. Key features include:

1. Randomly generated circles with varying sizes and positions
2. Smooth animation of circles expanding
3. Popping effect when circles reach a specified size
4. Implementation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for animations and rendering
The project showcases the ability to create dynamic visual effects and manage real-time animations using modern web technologies.

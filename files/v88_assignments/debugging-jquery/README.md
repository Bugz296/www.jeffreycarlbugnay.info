# Debugging jQuery

## Description
We were asked to clone the repository and correct the jQuery errors!
In this project, I tackled the task of debugging and enhancing a web application that aimed to highlight HTML elements upon hovering over them. The primary objective was to ensure the proper functionality of the jQuery library in handling hover events and applying visual effects to the targeted elements.

- Implements hover event listeners on specified HTML elements
- Applies a visual highlight effect (e.g., changing background color, adding a border) when an element is hovered over
- Removes the highlight effect when the user's cursor leaves the element
- Showcases the ability to debug and troubleshoot jQuery-based applications
- Demonstrates proficiency in utilizing jQuery for creating interactive and responsive web experiences
- Adheres to web development best practices and coding standards
- Focuses on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code

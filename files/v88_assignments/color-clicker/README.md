Project Title: "Color Clicker"
Project Description:
In this project, I developed an interactive web application called "Color Clicker" that explores the manipulation of colors and elements on a web page through user interactions. The project's objective was to create a simple yet engaging interface where clicking on different boxes would trigger specific color changes based on a set of predefined rules.
The application's user interface consists of three boxes: one large box and two smaller boxes positioned on either side of the large box. The rules governing the color changes are as follows:

1. Clicking the big box changes the background color of both the large and small boxes simultaneously.
2. Clicking the middle small box changes the background color of the large box.
3. Clicking the left or right small box changes the background color of the sibling small box.

To implement these rules, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defined the layout and positioning of the boxes, while CSS styling ensured an attractive and visually appealing presentation. The core functionality, however, was driven by JavaScript, where I implemented event listeners to capture user clicks and applied color changes accordingly.
Throughout the development process, I focused on writing clean, modular, and efficient code, adhering to best practices in web development. The project showcases my proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, and my ability to translate logical rules into functional web applications.
The "Color Clicker" application offers a simple yet engaging interactive experience, allowing users to explore the dynamic behavior of colors and elements on a web page. Whether you're interested in web development, user interactions, or simply enjoy playing with colors, this project provides an entertaining and visually appealing way to understand the power of JavaScript in manipulating web page elements.

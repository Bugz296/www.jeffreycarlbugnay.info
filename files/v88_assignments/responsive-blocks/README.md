# Responsive Blocks Project

## Description

The "Responsive Blocks" project was completed as part of an assignment for a web development course. The objective was to convert a static image of blocks into a responsive web page using only HTML and CSS. Unlike the previous assignments, this task required creating a layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Features

- Transformed the static image of blocks into a responsive web page layout using HTML and CSS.
- Implemented media queries to adjust the layout and styling based on different viewport sizes, ensuring responsiveness across a range of devices.
- Utilized flexible units like percentages, ems, or viewport units to create fluid and adaptable designs.
- Incorporated CSS grid or flexbox to create the layout structure and achieve responsiveness without relying on fixed-width containers.
- Included breakpoints strategically to modify the layout, typography, and other design elements for different screen sizes.
- Tested the responsiveness of the webpage using browser developer tools and real devices to ensure compatibility and consistency.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the webpage.
- CSS3: Utilized for styling, layout design, and responsiveness.
- Visual Studio Code: IDE used for coding and development.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.

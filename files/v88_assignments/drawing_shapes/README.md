This project is an interactive web-based assignment named "Drawing Shapes," where users can select a shape to draw on a canvas. Upon clicking on the canvas, the chosen shape is rendered at the click location. Key features include:

1. Shape selection options (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)
2. Interactive canvas that registers click events
3. Dynamic rendering of selected shapes at click positions
4. Implementation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for shape drawing and event handling

The project demonstrates proficiency in handling user inputs and dynamic graphics rendering using modern web technologies.

Features:
• Recreates a given image as a static web page pixel by pixel
• Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the desired visual representation
• Employs JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities to create and position HTML elements dynamically
• Demonstrates understanding of JavaScript loops and conditional statements
• Showcases the ability to work under time constraints and meet deadlines
• Highlights attention to detail and precision in replicating the image accurately
• Adheres to web development best practices and coding standards
• Focuses on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code
• Demonstrates problem-solving skills and the ability to translate visual designs into code

This project not only tests the developer's technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also challenges their ability to work efficiently under pressure and follow instructions precisely. The emphasis on attention to detail and time management encourages the developer to develop a keen eye for accuracy while honing their programming skills in a practical and engaging manner.

In this project, I took on the challenge of reimagining the classic arcade game Pac-Man as a web-based application. The objective was to recreate the iconic gameplay, visuals, and mechanics of the original Pac-Man while leveraging modern web technologies.
Using HTML5 canvas for rendering graphics, JavaScript for programming logic, and CSS for styling, I meticulously crafted a faithful adaptation of the beloved game. Players can control the famous yellow Pac-Man character, navigating through maze-like levels while collecting pellets and avoiding the relentless pursuit of the ghostly enemies.
The game accurately captures the essence of Pac-Man, including the iconic character movements, sound effects, and the thrill of chasing and being chased. Additionally, I implemented features such as high score tracking, multiple levels with increasing difficulty, and responsive design to ensure an optimal gaming experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Throughout the development process, I focused on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code, adhering to best practices in web development. The project showcases my proficiency in JavaScript programming, user interface design, and my ability to recreate a beloved gaming experience using modern web technologies.
Whether you're a fan of classic arcade games or simply appreciate well-executed web applications, this Pac-Man web recreation offers a nostalgic and entertaining experience that can be enjoyed directly in your web browser.

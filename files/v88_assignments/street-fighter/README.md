# Street Fighter Web Game Recreation

## Description

In this project, I undertook the challenge of recreating the iconic fighting game "Street Fighter" as a web-based application. Utilizing HTML5 canvas for rendering graphics, JavaScript for programming logic, and CSS for styling, I meticulously crafted a faithful adaptation that captured the essence of the original game.

Players can choose from a roster of iconic characters and engage in thrilling one-on-one battles against opponents or friends. The recreation accurately replicates the fast-paced combat mechanics, special moves, and the high-intensity atmosphere that made Street Fighter a beloved franchise.

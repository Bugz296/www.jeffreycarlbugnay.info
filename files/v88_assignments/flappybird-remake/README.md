In this project, I undertook the challenge of recreating the wildly popular mobile game "Flappy Bird" as a web-based application. Utilizing HTML5 canvas for rendering graphics, JavaScript for programming logic, and CSS for styling, I meticulously crafted a faithful adaptation that captured the essence of the original game. Players can control a bird character, navigating through a series of obstacles by tapping or clicking to make the bird flap its wings and remain airborne. The recreation accurately replicates the addictive gameplay, scoring system, and the thrilling experience of continuously avoiding obstacles that made Flappy Bird a cultural phenomenon. Throughout the development process, I focused on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code, adhering to best practices in web development. This project showcases my proficiency in JavaScript programming, user interface design, and my ability to recreate a beloved gaming experience using modern web technologies.

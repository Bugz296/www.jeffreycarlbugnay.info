This project is an interactive web-based assignment where users can click anywhere on a canvas to create expanding circles. Key features include:

1. Responsive canvas that registers click events
2. Circles that animate and expand from the clicked position
3. Implementation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for rendering and animations
4. Dynamic and visually engaging user interactions

The project demonstrates the ability to handle user inputs, perform real-time animations, and create interactive graphics using modern web technologies.
